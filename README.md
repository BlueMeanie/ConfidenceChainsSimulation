Simulations of Confidence Chains Patterns

This is a Java program for testing Confidence Chains Patterns.  It allows the developer to see how CCs will play out
under different Identity Weight scenarios and other situations.

The Confidence Chains whitepaper can be found here: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwUFHE6KYsM0ZkxLVmFwbXQ3ck0/edit?usp=sharing

currently requires JDK (later will offer Jar file).  Eclipse is probably optimal.

also to render block tree graphs, DOT must be installed on the command line.
